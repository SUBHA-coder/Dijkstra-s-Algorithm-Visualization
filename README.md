# Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualization

## Project Overview
This project visualizes Dijkstra's algorithm in both 2D and 3D. It uses **Matplotlib** for 2D visualization and **Plotly** for an interactive 3D view. The graph is generated using the `networkx` library, and the algorithm processes node distances in real-time.

## Prerequisites
Install the following Python libraries:
```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib plotly
